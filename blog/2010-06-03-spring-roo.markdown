So I stumbled across Spring Roo a couple of times recently and haven't really looked into it much. I finally decided to do a little bit of reading on it, starting [here](http://static.springsource.org/spring-roo/reference/html/intro.html#intro-what-is-roo). It seems like a pretty fascinating tool, providing intelligent tools to help develop an application without layering any actual IDE requirements, runtime libraries, bloated annotation models into the mix. I'm also especially interested to see exactly how this works in practice with Google Web Toolkit, as it could provide a very powerful framework to develop rich web client functionality and robust backend datastore+business logic facades very rapidly.

When I get a bit of time soon I'm definitely gonna check this out further and post more thoughts on it.
