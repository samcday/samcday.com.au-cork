So, one of my all-time favourite bands, the almighty [Dillinger Escape Plan](http://www.myspace.com/dillingerescapeplan), is releasing a new album titled "**Option Paralysis**". It's set to be released near the end of this month.

I've known about it for a couple of months, saw a couple of cool little vids on their [Youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/ChuckBillyTotemPoll). The soundbites of their tracking sessions sounded BRUTAL, I was already pumped after the little teasers they posted. Now they have a full track from the new album released - "Farewell, Mono Lisa". It sounds FANTASTIC, kind of like a blend between their Miss Machine and Ire Works stuff. After hearing some of Greg Puciato's clean vocals in his work with [Spylacopa](http://www.myspace.com/spylacopa), I was really looking forward to hearing more of it with DEP. Looks like my wish was granted.

Cannot wait for this album to come out!
