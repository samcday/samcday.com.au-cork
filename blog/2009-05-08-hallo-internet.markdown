I think I still scorn people who rant on the internet and think other people care what they have to say. I don't know anymore. Here I am ranting now ... Is anyone listening?...

...

Anyway. I has a blog. I'm going to post things to it as I see fit. I find it easier to think things through if I write them down as if someone else is reading them.

I'll probably be posting things here related to the work I am doing currently (general technology stuff, web technologies, etc). And maybe personal stuff when I'm feeling down and need to pretend people are reading and caring.

So I guess now I need to go play around with Wordpress settings and make categories and stuffs.
