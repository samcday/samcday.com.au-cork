Took a break from work for a few mins and let myself get sidetracked ...

I stumbled upon this website: [http://www.chromeexperiments.com/](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/)

There is some amazing stuff on there. I did not think Javascript could produce such amazing results. It's also hilarious to see how well Google Chrome outperforms Firefox (check out the Monster experiment, compare Firefox and chrome, lol.).

Welp ... back to work ...
