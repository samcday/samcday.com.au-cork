Sup peoples.

Please, for the love of god, sign up a Bugzilla account at developers.facebook.com and vote up a few bugs that are really starting to piss me off in the land of Facebook!

[Bug #10291](http://bugs.developers.facebook.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10291) - an annoying bug that prevents proper auto configuration of a Facebook Application using application.setProperties.
[Bug #10454](http://bugs.developers.facebook.com/show_bug.cgi?id=10454) - another fantastic little issue that causes permission dialogs in Profile Tabs to do weird stuff...
[Bug #8260](http://bugs.developers.facebook.com/show_bug.cgi?id=8260) - a bug that prevents a parent Facebook application from modifying the settings of a child application that was created by it.

Just a small taste of the bugs that are plaguing me at the moment.
