Okay, I've played around with [Google Building Maker](http://sketchup.google.com/3dwh/buildingmaker.html). Honestly, the idea itself deserves accolades, the implementation is, in my mind, flawless. The app is yet another step in digitizing the world we live in, and it's plain *fun*!!!

I'm looking forward to Google bringing this app a bit closer to home, I can't wait to map the buildings in my local neighborhood!!
